# Description
- A project for my AI class. 
- The user will be able to choose a valid starting and ending position on a black and white image.
- A path will be calculated using A* algorithm and then saved to an image

# How to use
1. Install Python 3 if not already installed. Do not install Python 3.8--as opencv is not currently compatible with it.
2. Run the command "python maze.py" from terminal.
3. Double left-click on the image window that pops up and select a starting and ending point.
4. Once the program prompts for a file name to be entered, enter a filename that ends with ".jpg"
5. The program is now done running. The resulting image should be saved in the same folder containing the program.
